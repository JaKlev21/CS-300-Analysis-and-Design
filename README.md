# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

This class was a lot more fun than previous classes that dealt with less programming and more concepts. I enjoyed applying the same data to differenct data structures to understand how each data structure was implemented and used. Having the same data for each module allowed easier comparision to the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure.
